1. Dealing With Form Submission & Getting User Input Values:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   > There are two main ways of fetching user input:
      - Listen on every keystroke and store the value in some state variable.
      - Use a ref to fetch the input one the user is done typing in a value.
   > In reality you will only use one of the two approaches.

   Listen to User Input on Every Keystroke Example:
      import React, { useState } from 'react';
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         const [enteredName, setEnteredName] = useState('');
         const nameInputChangeHandler = (event) => {
            setEnteredName(event.target.value);
         };
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            console.log(enteredName);
         };
         return (
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className='form-control'>
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' onChange={nameInputChangeHandler} />
               </div>
               <div className="form-actions">
                  <button>Submit</button>
               </div>
            </form>
         );
      };

   > Import the useState from the React Library in order to store state variable.
   > Create a function which receives the event object as a argument/parameter. Using the event object you can capture the .target.value from the event object (i.e. the user input) which can be stored in the state using the state updating function.
   > The 'event.target' object will be the input that the function gets attached to which allows us to extract the '.value' from that user input field.
   > Finally, bind the event function to the input using the 'onChange' event. This will trigger the function on every keystroke and ultimately update the stored state value.
   > Remember: when binding the function to not use the parenthesis (i.e. round brackets) at the end. This would tell JavaScript to execute the function straight away and would re-execute each time the Component function is re-evaluated/re-executed. Instead, you want point to the function and this function will only execute when the event trigger is executed.
   > The formSubmissionHandler is another event function you would create and bind it to the form 'onSubmit' event. This function will also receives an event object.
   > Using the event object you would want to use the '.preventDefault()' method to prevent the default browser behaviour.
   > When a form is submitted with a button inside of a form a HTTP request is sent to the server serving the website. This occurs automatically by the browser. The issue here is that you do not have a server that wants to do anything with that request (i.e. you have a static server which serves your JavaScript and HTML files). The '.preventDefault()' will tell the browser not to do this default behaviour.
   > When HTTP requests are sent by the browser, it also leads to the page being reloaded again. You would want to prevent this default behaviour using the '.preventDefault()' method otherwise this will restart the entire application again losing all the state and not have the behaviour you would want.
   > The 'console.log(enteredName)' will display the last name stored in the state variable (i.e. the input value). You could do anything at this point on the form submission function.

   Listen to User Input with useRef Example:
      import React, { useState } from 'react';
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         const nameInputRef = useRef();
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            const enteredValue = nameInputRef.current.value;
            console.log(enteredValue);
         };
         return (
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className='form-control'>
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' ref={nameInputRef} />
               </div>
               <div className="form-actions">
                  <button>Submit</button>
               </div>
            </form>
         );
      };

   > Import the useRef from the React Library. This will allow you set a ref on an input in order to read the value from the input when needed.
   > Create a variable and assign it a value calling the 'useRef()' function.
   > Set the variable as the ref to the input element using the special 'ref' prop. React provides this 'ref' prop which allows you to set on any default HTML element.
   > In the formSubmissionHandler function you can now create a variable that can reach out and access the value in the ref prop variable (e.g. 'nameInputRef').
   > Every React 'ref' prop objects has a '.current' property which holds the value assigned to the element assigned to the ref. In the above example the 'nameInputRef' reference has a pointer to the <input> element which will be stored in the '.current' property. This then allows you to access the input value using '.current.value' property.
   > JavaScript objects representing HTML input elements always has a value property which holds the value of the currently entered within that input element.
   > The 'console.log(enteredValue)' will display the input value stored in the input element using a reference to that input element object. You could do anything at this point on the form submission function.

   > How would you decide which approach to use? This all depends on what you plan to do with the entered user input. But as a general guidance:
      - If only interested in the value once after the form is submitted then a useRef approach is better for this scenario. This is because logging/updating the state value on every keystroke might be an overkill.
      - If you need the entered value after every keystroke for instant validation then using the useState approach is better for this scenario. This is because the useRef approach cannot accomplish this requirement.
      - If you want to reset the user input after a form submission using the useState approach is better for this scenario. Below is an example code of how to handle this behaviour with useState which is not possible with useRef:

      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         ...
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => { setEnteredName('') };
         return (
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className='form-control'>
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' onChange={nameInputChangeHandler} value={enteredName} />
               </div>
               <div className="form-actions">
                  <button>Submit</button>
               </div>
            </form>
         );
      };

      > On the 'formSubmissionHandler' function you would reset the state by calling the state updating function and set it to an empty string.
      > On the input element use the 'value' prop to bind the state to the element. This will then clear the input on the form submission event because the state value is bound to the input using the 'value' prop.

      - Resetting the form input could be achieved with the useRef approach but is much less elegant compared to the above useState example. This is achieved by accessing the input value property and setting it to an empty string (e.g. nameInputRef.current.value = ''). However, this approach is not recommended because you are directly manipulating the DOM with this approach rather than having React manipulate the DOM.
      - React should be the only thing that should manipulate the DOM.

   > Now that you can listen to user input, how can you validate the user input?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Adding Basic Validation and Providing Validation Feedback:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   > Important Note: Client side validation (i.e. within the browser) should not be the only validation you should be doing with real applications. Validation on the Client is great for the User Experience because it provides direct feedback to the user but you should also always validate input on the server. This is because code on the Client can be edited by the user within their browser and cannot be reliable.
   > Code on the client is there to provide a good user experience and it is not a security mechanism.
   > Browser Security Further Reading: https://academind.com/tutorials/hide-javascript-code/

   > To add a Client side validation to a form input you can add an if statement to check form fields on a form submission. The exact form validation logic you need will depend on form input value you are expecting.

   Basic Form Validation Example:
      ...
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         ...
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            if(enteredName.trim() === '') {
               return;
            };
            console.log(enteredName);
            setEnteredName('')
         };
         return(...);
      };

   > If the if statement condition evaluates to true i.e. the input field is empty, you would return the function. This will prevent the rest of the code below within the function from executing because in JavaScript when a function reaches a 'return' statement it will stop the execution of the function whether or not something is returned from that function execution.
   > Now that you have some Client side form validation, you would want to display some form of error feedback to the user.

   Providing Basic Form Validation Feedback Example:
      ...
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         ...
         const [enteredNameIsValid, setEnteredNameIsValid] = useState(true);
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            if(enteredName.trim() === '') {
               setEnteredNameIsValid(false);
               return;
            };
            setEnteredNameIsValid(true);
            console.log(enteredName);
            setEnteredName('')
         };
         const nameInputClasses = enteredNameIsValid ? 'form-control' : 'form-control invalid';
         return(
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className={nameInputClasses} >
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' ref={nameInputRef} onChange={nameInputChangeHandler} value={enteredName} />
                  { !enteredNameIsValid && <p className="error-text">Name must not be empty.</p> }
               </div>
            </form>
            ...
         );
      };

   > A state is created to capture whether the form input field is valid using a boolean value. This is initially set to true so that the error message does not appear before the user has had a chance to enter some input.
   > This state value is then updated when the form is being submitted i.e. using the if statement to see whether the input field is valid or not and setting the updated state value accordingly.
   > The state can now be used in the JSX code to conditionally render a HTML element to display some form of error feedback message to the user on the screen.
   > This is one such way to provide some feedback to the user when something is wrong.
   > You can also use the validation state to dynamically set a variable value which can be used to update the CSS class applied to the JSX code as seen with in the above example with the wrapping div element. This provides dynamic visual feedback based on the CSS class applied to a element.
   > This is a perfectly fine approach to adding form validation but this approach has some downside.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Handling the 'was touched' State:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   > A downside of the basic form validation feedback seen in the previous example is having the 'enteredNameIsValid' state which starts with 'true' as its value. This implies the input field is initially valid. This is not the case and it is set to true to avoid showing the error state when the form initially loads.
   > The problem with this approach, for example, if you had some 'useEffect()' side effect code which would trigger whenever the 'enteredNameIsValid' dependency changes. If the code triggered when the state was valid then the code will execute when the form is loaded:

   Downside Example:
      import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         const [enteredNameIsValid, setEnteredNameIsValid] = useState(true);
         useEffect(() => {
            if(enteredNameIsValid) {
               console.log('Name input is valid!');
            };
         }, [enteredNameIsValid]);
         ...
         render(...);
      };

   > The issue here is that the 'useEffect()' side effect would execute when the application is loaded because the dependency 'enteredNameIsValid' would be set for the first time and because it is set as true (even though the input is actually not valid) this will trigger the if statement block code. You would see the 'Name input is valid!' printed to the browser console.
   > Imagine if the code block was to send a HTTP request or something else when the state is set to true. This will cause an undesired effect just because we intentionally set the state to an incorrect value to workaround/overcome the initial issue of hiding the error message before the user has a chance to enter some input.
   > Furthermore, the code might not read correctly (initially) if someone else was to look at the code fort the first time without understanding why you did what you did.
   > To overcome this you could create another state to see whether or not the user has touched the input and only then check and update the state accordingly.

   Has Touched State Example:
      import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         const [enteredNameIsValid, setEnteredNameIsValid] = useState(false);
         const [enteredNameTouched, setEnteredNameTouched] = useState(false);
         useEffect(() => {
            if(enteredNameIsValid) {
               console.log('Name input is valid!');
            };
         }, [enteredNameIsValid]);
         ...
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            setEnteredNameTouched(true);
            ...
         };
         ...
         const nameInputIsInvalid = !enteredNameIsValid && enteredNameTouched;
         const nameInputClasses = nameInputIsInvalid ? 'form-control invalid' : 'form-control';
         render(
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className={nameInputClasses} >
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' ref={nameInputRef} onChange={nameInputChangeHandler} value={enteredName} />
                  { nameInputIsInvalid && <p className="error-text">Name must not be empty.</p> }
               </div>
            </form>
            ...
         );
      };

   > This now allows you to have the correct initial values for the state and when the user does touch a input field only then would you check for validation and display the error feedback messages.
   > You now need to decide how you would update the touched state e.g. on form submission on on input keystroke event etc.
   > This is a little more code than before but it is a better/cleaner code. This also allows you to handle more case scenarios and the code works exactly as you would expect it to without running into any unexpected logic bugs cause by some workaround fix.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Reacting to Lost Focus using onBlur:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   > In the previous example, while we were able to fix the form validation feedback logic using the touched event; however, the error message will now only appear when the form is submitted.
   > How can we handle the situation whereby the user is shown the error message after they had the chance to touch the input but then remove all the text making the field invalid but have not submitted the form?
   > You can validate on 'blur' (i.e. when the input loses focus). React provides the 'onBlur' prop event which will fire whenever the element loses focus.

   React onBlur Prop (Losing Focus Event) Example:
      import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         ...
         const nameInputBlurHandler = (event) => {
            setEnteredNameTouched(true);

            if(enteredName.trim() === '') {
               setEnteredNameIsValid(false);
               return;
            };
         };
         ...
         render(
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className={nameInputClasses} >
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' ref={nameInputRef} onChange={nameInputChangeHandler} onBlur={nameInputBlurHandler} value={enteredName} />
                  { nameInputIsInvalid && <p className="error-text">Name must not be empty.</p> }
               </div>
            </form>
            ...
         );
      };

   > The input field is provided the 'onBlur' prop which points at the 'nameInputBlurHandler' function. This function will be triggered whenever this input loses focus.
   > The function will set the "enteredNameTouched" state to true because if an input lost focus it definitely has been touched. In addition you may wish to re-run validation at this point in order to display the error feedback message if the form input was incorrect.
   > Important Note: the if statement condition can be seen as code duplication but it is ok for this demonstration but realistically you would refactor that logic to abide by the DRY principal.
   > The code now provides a better user experience as the error message appears not only when you submit the form but when you touch and lose focus of an input.
   > The last issue you know have is that when the user starts to type something into the input field the error feedback message continues to be shown until the user submits the form. You may wish to add some logic on the keystroke event which would allow the user to fix the error and hide it once they start typing into the input field - example logic shown below:

   On Keystroke Hide Error Message Logic Example:
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         const nameInputChangeHandler = (event) => {
            setEnteredName(event.target.value);
            if(event.target.value.trim() !== '') {
               setEnteredNameIsValid(true);
            };
         };
      };

   > Therefore, this hopefully demonstrates why you may end up using a combination of all three cases (i.e. when form is submitted, when input lost focus and on every keystroke) for immediate form validation feedback and a better reactive ad interactive user experience overall.
   > Below is a refactored code example demonstrating a cleaner code which achieves the same form validation and validation feedback providing a good user experience.

   Refactored Form Validation Example:
      import React, { useState } from 'react';
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         const [enteredName, setEnteredName] = useState('');
         const [enteredNameTouched, setEnteredNameTouched] = useState(false);
         const enteredNameIsValid = enteredName.trim() !== '';
         const nameInputIsInvalid = !enteredNameIsValid && enteredNameTouched;
         const nameInputChangeHandler = (event) => { setEnteredName(event.target.value) };
         const nameInputBlurHandler = (event) => { setEnteredNameTouched(true) };
         const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            if(!enteredNameIsValid) { return };
            console.log(enteredName);
            setEnteredName('');
            setEnteredNameTouched(false);
         };
         const nameInputClasses = nameInputIsInvalid ? 'form-control invalid' : 'form-control';
         return(
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               <div className={nameInputClasses} >
                  <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                  <input type='text' id='name' onChange={nameInputChangeHandler} onBlur={nameInputBlurHandler} value={enteredName} />
                  { nameInputIsInvalid && <p className="error-text">Name must not be empty.</p> }
               </div>
               <div className="form-actions">
                  <button>Submit</button>
               </div>
            </form>
         );
      };
      export default SimpleInput;

   > Notice in the above code that the "enteredNameIsValid" derives its value from the other states. The "nameInputIsInvalid" can use the derived "enteredNameIsValid" state in its logic. This allows the code to be a lot more leaner without requiring too manu individual states.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Managing the Overall Form Validity:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   > So far we have explored the form validity on a single input. Often you would have more than one input and in such scenarios it would be nice to find out whether the overall form is valid on submissions and not the single input only. The overall form is only valid if all the inputs within the form are valid.
   > How can you take into account the overall form validity? one way is to add a new state.

   Overall Form Validity Using useState Example:
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         ...
         const [formIsValid, setFormIsValid] = useState(false);
         useEffect(() => {
            if(enteredNameIsValid && enteredAgeIsValid) {
               setFormIsValid(true);
            } else {
               setFormIsValid(false);
            };
         }, [enteredNameIsValid, enteredAgeIsValid]);
         return(
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               ...
               <div className="form-actions">
                  <button disabled={!formIsValid}>Submit</button>
               </div>
            </form>
         );
      };

   CSS Styling for disabled button:
      button:hover,
      button:active {
         background-color: #33059e;
         border-color: #33059e;
      }
      button:disabled,
      button:disabled:hover,
      button:disabled:active {
         background-color: #ccc;
         border-color: #ccc;
         color: #292929;
         cursor: not-allowed;
      }

   > The formIsValid is set to false when it is initialised because the form initially will not be valid.
   > You can then update this overall form state whenever one of the form inputs changes. For this you can use the 'useEffect()' Hook to handle this side effect.
   > As dependencies you would add all the form validities. Whenever the value of the dependency changes the effect would run again (it would also run for the first initialisation of the Component function). The logic in the side effect would then combine all the dependencies and check if they are all valid and if true then the overall form validity can be set to true.
   > The above example demonstrates where there are two input fields to the overall form i.e. "enteredNameIsValid" and "enteredAgeIsValid".
   > Whenever one of the input is invalid then the overall form validation will be set to false else the form is valid and the state will be set to true.
   > This overall form state can then be used to 'disabled' the Submit button when the overall form state evaluates to false (i.e. '<button disabled={!formIsValid}>').
   > If you take a closer look at the above example you will notice that the useEffect is not even needed. You are not performing any side effect. All that you are doing here is deriving a new value for the overall form validity. So while you can use useEffect, it adds extra Component re-evaluation cycles which is not an advantage.

   Alternative Overall Form Validity Using Derived State Variable Example:
      const SimpleInput = (props) => {
         ...
         let formIsValid = false;
         if(enteredNameIsValid && enteredAgeIsValid) {
            formIsValid = true;
         };
         return(
            <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
               ...
               <div className="form-actions">
                  <button disabled={!formIsValid}>Submit</button>
               </div>
            </form>
         );
      };

   > The derived state variable "formIsValid" is initially set to false when the variable is created. The if statement will check all the other validity states are true before updating the derived state value to true. This then provides the same functionality but without requiring the "useEffect()" Hook. This approach allows you to write much more leaner code for your Component functions which may also be more performant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Adding a Custom Input Hook & Re-using the Custom Hook:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   > When you have a lot of duplication (i.e. the variables names are not exactly the same but the overall logic structure is the same) the Component code could look complex especially when the form has more inputs.
   > Typically you would want to outsource some of the logic somewhere so that you do not need to retype and repeat the same code all the time.
   > How best can you achieve this? One way could be to consider creating a separate input Component. Within that Component you would have the logic to validate the input Component. While this is one solution that could work, you would need to find a solution to managing the overall form validity which can be a little more tricky with this approach.
   > If you manage every input as an individual closed thing (via a input Component approach) you then need to find a way of letting the overall form know if all the inputs are valid or not. This could certainly be done using props and passing functions to props and calling them from the input Component and so on; however, there is another approach.
   > You can use a Custom Hook to manage all the state logic. The hook should therefore be flexible in managing the input states i.e. the Custom Hook should be generic and not limited to one specific input.

   Custom Hook Example:
      src/hooks/use-input.js:
         import { useState } from "react";
         const useInput = (validateValue) => {
            const [enteredValue, setEnteredValue] = useState('');
            const [isTouched, setIsTouched] = useState(false);
            const valueIsValid = validateValue(enteredValue);
            const hasError = !valueIsValid && isTouched;
            const valueChangeHandler = (event) => { setEnteredValue(event.target.value) };
            const inputBlurHandler = (event) => { setIsTouched(true) };
            const reset = () => {
               setEnteredValue('');
               setIsTouched(false);
            };
            return {
               value: enteredValue,
               isValid: valueIsValid,
               hasError,
               valueChangeHandler,
               inputBlurHandler,
               reset
            };
         };
         export default useInput;

      src/components/SimpleInput.js:
         import React from 'react';
         import useInput from '../hooks/use-input';
         const SimpleInput = (props) => {
            const { 
               value: enteredName,
               isValid: enteredNameIsValid,
               hasError: nameInputHasError,
               valueChangeHandler: nameChangedHandler,
               inputBlurHandler: nameBlueHandler,
               reset: resetNameInput
            } = useInput(value => value.trim() !== '');
            const { 
               value: enteredEmail,
               isValid: enteredEmailIsValid,
               hasError: emailInputHasError,
               valueChangeHandler: emailChangedHandler,
               inputBlurHandler: emailBlueHandler,
               reset: resetEmailInput
            } = useInput(value => value.includes('@'));
            let formIsValid = false;
            if(enteredNameIsValid && enteredEmailIsValid) { formIsValid = true };
            const formSubmissionHandler = (event) => {
               event.preventDefault();
               if(!enteredNameIsValid) { return };
               console.log(enteredName);
               resetNameInput();
               resetEmailInput();
            };
            const nameInputClasses = nameInputHasError ? 'form-control invalid' : 'form-control';
            const emailInputClasses = emailInputHasError ? 'form-control invalid' : 'form-control';
            return(
               <form onSubmit={formSubmissionHandler} >
                  <div className={nameInputClasses} >
                     <label htmlFor='name'>Your Name</label>
                     <input type='text' id='name' onChange={nameChangedHandler} onBlur={nameBlueHandler} value={enteredName} />
                     { nameInputHasError && <p className="error-text">Name must not be empty.</p> }
                  </div>
                  <div className={emailInputClasses} >
                     <label htmlFor='email'>Your Email</label>
                     <input type='email' id='email' onChange={emailChangedHandler} onBlur={emailBlueHandler} value={enteredEmail} />
                     { emailInputHasError && <p className="error-text">Please enter a valid email.</p> }
                  </div>
                  <div className="form-actions">
                     <button disabled={!formIsValid}>Submit</button>
                  </div>
               </form>
            );
         };
         export default SimpleInput;

   > Custom Hooks can take in functions as argument/parameter as seen with the "validateValue".
   > The Custom Hook should return something. In the above example this is an object because we want to return more than one thing.
   > Note: Modern JavaScript allows you to write short form of e.g. "hasError" within an object which is the same as writing "hasError: hasError".
   > The functions defined in the return object allows you to expose these state updating functions to the place where the Custom Hook is being used.
   > You can call the Custom Hook and extract values from the results object returned by the Custom Hook using JavaScript's object destructuring.
   > Aliases are assigned to the values extracted which is required to avoid any variable name clashes when using the Custom Hook for multiple inputs.
   > The anonymous function is defined outside the Custom Hook but is passed in as the "validateValue" argument/parameter and that function is actually executed inside the Custom Hook's 'const valueIsValid = validateValue(enteredValue);' line where the argument/parameter is being called. The "enteredValue" which is the state that is being managed in the Custom Hook, is the value that gets passed into this function. This can be a little tricky to get your head around but this is all just regular JavaScript where you are passing a function as a value to another function.
   > The form would continue to work as before but now using Custom Hooks to outsource repeating/duplicate logic which ultimately will help lean the Component code.

   When to Validate Diagram:
   [When Form is Submitted]               [When a Input Loses Focus]                [On every Keystroke]
   Allow a user to enter a                Allow the user to enter a                 Warn the user before they
   valid value before warning             a valid value before warnings             had the chance of entering
   the user.                              the user.                                 valid values.

   Avoid unnecessary warnings             Very useful for untouched                 If applied only on invalid
   but maybe present feedback             forms.                                    inputs, has the potential of 
   "too late".                                                                      providing more direct feedback.

   > You can read the following article on creating a more elaborate Custom Hooks (https://academind.com/tutorials/reactjs-a-custom-useform-hook/).
   > There are many great third party libraries that can be of interest to you and your future projects. For example, Formik (https://formik.org/) is a very popular library for creating Form Components for React projects. The core idea is that you do not have to write much state management logic but instead you write your validation logic, define your fields and then let Formik do the rest.
   > You should now be well prepared to handle forms and user inputs in your next projects.
