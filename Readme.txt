Learning Folder Directory Structure:
- There are three main learning folders:
   1. Summaries & Refreshers
   2. Basics & Foundation
   3. Advanced Concepts

- Within these folders will be bite-sized topics and each will contain a number. Each topic will have a number and these numbers will help guide you in a structured learning path. for example:
   1. Summaries & Refreshers
      > 1. JavaScript Refresher

- You can use this structured learning path to review topics or alternatively you can visit whichever topic you require to build your knowledge on.
- Either approach is OK but for beginners it is recommended to take the first approach of going through each topic sequentially.
